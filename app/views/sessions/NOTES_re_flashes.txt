Flashes
We want to be able to flash messages to the user, indicating that everything is A-OK or not, so we render flashes first of all inside the body, we will create a partial view for this, so start by adding a folder in the app/views directory called application, and inside it create a file called _flashes.html.haml, make note of the leading underscore in the file name. Inside said file, enter:

#flash
 - flash.each do |type, message|
 .alert.alert-dismissable{ :class => twitterized_type(type) }
 %button.close{"data-dismiss" => "alert", "aria-hidden" => "true"} Ã—
 %p= message
Here we take each of the applications flashes and give them a class and content based on the type of flash that is beeing sent, which is determined by our helper twitterized_type, so inside application_helper.rb, add the following:

def twitterized_type(type)
 case type
 when :errors
 "alert-error"
 when :alert
 "alert-warning"
 when :error
 "alert-error"
 when :notice
 "alert-success"
 else
 "alert-info"
 end
end
This will add the appropriate bootstrap classes to the alerts so that a success is green, a warning is yellow and so on.
